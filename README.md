            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ethan I am currently 19 years old and striving to become a successful software developer.
                <br>
                <p>
                    Six months ago I interned at quite a big IT firm for a week, which gave me some hands-on experience on what being a software
                    developer is. I am currently doing a Software Engineer bootcamp at HyperionDev.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am motivated by failure, seeing it as a chance to learn and grow. Each setback strengthens my determination and resilience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future I would like to see myself working at a big IT firm as a software engineer.
